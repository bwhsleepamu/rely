    * Attributes:
        - name
        - description
        - start and end dates
    * Associations:
        - has many SETS

2. SET
    * Description: Represents a collection of STUDIES, usually grouped by type of the raw data.
    * Attributes:
        - SET Type:
            Composite of all study types in the given SET. Error if more than one STUDY TYPE in a SET.
    * Associations:
        - belongs to many PROJECTS
        - contains many STUDIES

3. STUDY
    * Description: Represents a SET of raw data, identified by an original id.
    * Attributes:
        - Original ID:
            The permanent, master identification information for the particular STUDY, which should be obscured from
            re-scorers.

            WARNING: ORIGINAL ID for different types of data is not unique.
            Original ID/Type combination will be unique.

        - Location:
            The physical (filesystem) location of the given SET of data. The original data is uploaded and put in a folder
            at a predefined location (STUDY directory), with the study folder name corresponding to the study's unique id.

        - Reliability IDs:
            Automatically generated ID numbers that are mapped to this particular STUDY. Unique Reliability IDs will be
            generated for studies sent out to the individual USERS with a given EXERCISE. Each USER/EXERCISE combination
            will receive a unique ID. Unique ID generator.

            Implementation: A table associating an original ID to many Reliability IDs.
    * Associations:
        - belongs to many SETS
        - contain 1 "original" RESULT
        - contains many re-scored RESULTS
        - belongs to one STUDY TYPE

4. RESULT
    * Description:
        Represents the scoring RESULTS done on a given STUDY. There will be one original RESULT, created by a system
        admin. Rescored RESULTS will be created by a USER as they complete an EXERCISE.
    * Attributes:
        - Type: Two types currently identified are "original" and "rescored".
        - Location: The physical (file system) location where the result is stored. Location will be managed by the
                    application.
    * Associations:
        - belongs to one USER
        - belongs to one STUDY
        - belongs to one EXERCISE (except original?)
        - belongs to one RULE
        - contains one QUALITY ASSESSMENT FORM

    * Original Result:
        - Will not belong to an EXERCISE.
        - Will be uploaded by system admin for a given STUDY and RULE.

5. EXERCISE
    * Description:
        An EXERCISE represents a reliability exercise which can be assigned by a system admin. An exercise maps <<one or
        more?>> SETS to one or more USERS.

        An EXERCISE can be completed on a couple of different levels:
            1. A USER involved in the EXERCISE uploads a RESULT for a STUDY contained in the SET involved in the
             EXERCISE. The USER also fills out a QUALITY ASSESSMENT FORM.
               * this needs to be tracked
            2. A USER completes all assigned STUDIES and uploads all required RESULTS.
            3. All USERS complete all STUDIES in the assigned SETS and finish the respective EXERCISE.

        << This is a very complicated object/idea. We need to keep track of the completion status at all these
           different levels, and connect the USERS, STUDIES, SETS, RESULTS, and FORM INFORMATION >>
        << USER-EXERCISE to keep track of #2 on the list and store end-of-exercise FORM INFORMATION ? >>
        << USER-EXERCISE-STUDY to keep track of #1? >>
        << COMPLICATED!! More clear if we make RESULT belong to an EXERCISE (except for the original result?) >>
