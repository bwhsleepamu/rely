This readme assumes the following installation directory: /var/www/rely

  cd /var/www

  git clone git://github.com/pmanko/rely.git

  cd rely

  bundle install

  ruby lib/initial_setup.rb

  bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production

  bundle exec rake assets:precompile

Run Rails Server (or use Apache or nginx)

  rails s -p80

Open a browser and go to: http://localhost

All done!

== Contributing to Rely

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
